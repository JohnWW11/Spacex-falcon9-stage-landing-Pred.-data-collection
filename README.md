SpaceX Falcon 9 first stage Landing Prediction â€“ Collecting the data
DS-Capstone Project, that will predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch. In this lab, you will collect and make sure the data is in the correct format from an API. The following is an example of a successful and launch.

Added Web Scraping Falcon 9 and Heavy Launches Records from Wikipedia -Jupyter LAB file 

Added Data Wrangling - Exploring the perform of some Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to find some patterns in the data and determine what would be the label for training supervised models.

Added EDA Assignment: SQL Notebook for Peer Assignment - Using this Python notebook for the:
Understand the Spacex DataSet
Load the dataset into the corresponding table in a Db2 database
Execute SQL queries to answer assignment questions

Added Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Visualization - crucial step in understanding and summarizing the data 
Added - Completed Interactive-Folium-Launch site Project - Tasks 1-3
Added SpaceX Interactive Dasbioard files. IDE did not wiork as it should and the app coiuld not render as it should
